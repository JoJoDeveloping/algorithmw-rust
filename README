This project is an update of Noah Weninger's version of algorithm W in Rust. It uses modern Rust features,
and most importantly represents the Substitution as mutable state instead of passing it around explicitly,

Original Code, along with sources, is from https://github.com/nwoeanhinnogaehr/algorithmw-rust
